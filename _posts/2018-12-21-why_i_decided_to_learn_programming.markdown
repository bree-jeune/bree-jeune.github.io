So after years of attempting to learn how to code on my own, I decided to go for it and apply to Flatiron’s Community-Powered Bootcamp. I’ll admit it is quite a commitment and investment, but I feel like its overdue.

The reason why I decided to take the plunge finally? Well, I’ll be honest…I hate my current job, and the allure of the Silicon Valley lifestyle is one to be desired.

With that being said, I don’t entirely live in La-La-Land. I am highly aware of the competitiveness even to get a foot in the door over there, but I have to admit, it makes for a damn good daydream.

I currently work as a paramedic in the Northern Virginia (NOVA) region. Saving lives is intense and satisfying. At least it would be if that’s what I was actually doing. 

I am apart of the transport side of emergency medical services which is all of the guts with none of the glory. I made a conscious decision to maintain my career on the path of interfacility transport but the days of me being a glorified Uber driver are numbered. 

It’s not that I don’t understand that the work I do is important as I am a link in the chain of a patient receiving proper care. It’s mainly the fact that I saw my life going in a completely different direction from its present state. 

Nevertheless, I have always been a problem solver. This comes in handy as a medic, but I can’t help the gnawing feeling in my heart that tells me to do more.

I want to learn to code so that I can build products that can be swiftly and cleanly integrated into a patient’s healthcare experience. There are so many problems to solve in this field and way too many to list in this post. 

Learning to code and making more user-friendly experiences for EMS providers, doctors, nurses, and patients is my new mission. With all the work ahead of me, I needed a strong foundation and the ability to collaborate. This reason is why I have turned to Flatiron to build my home. 

I am looking forward to the journey.
